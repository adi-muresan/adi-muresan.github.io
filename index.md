I am currently leading the R&D department of [3D Hubs](https://3dhubs.com), the largest network for online manufacturing services.
We use computational geometry to extract relevant information from 3D models and deep learning to use this information in interesting ways.

Printivate was a 3D model repair and optimization platform that targets 3D printing. This was achieved through a 3D model processing SaaS platform
that was easy to integrate into existing products through a flexible API.

For three years I was doing full-time research in the field of resource management for large scale distributed IaaS platforms.

In 2012 I obtained a PhD in Resource management for large scale Cloud Platforms at
Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon in the Avalon research team, under
the supervision of [Frédéric Desprez](https://fdesprez.github.io/) and [Eddy Caron](http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~ecaron/). Over the period of
my PhD I worked on automatic application scaling and criterion-based
deployment of large-scale applications on Infrastructure as a Service Cloud
platforms.
