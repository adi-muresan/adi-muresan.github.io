I am a professional research scientist focused on solving complex real world problems with applied math and AI. My experience is in industrial research, applied AI, building scientific computing platforms, high performance computing platforms, distributed systems and computational geometry.

I enjoy working in interdisciplinary teams and applying modern statistical modeling and compute concepts to other fields.

With a versatile development skill set ranging from fast prototyping, to building real world performance oriented platforms, there is nothing I enjoy more than solving hard problems.

At AON my goal is to build AI for extrusion based processing of high performance polymers. As an individual contributor, I conduct novel research and build prototypes to validate research hypothesis using applied math and modern AI approaches for simulating physical phenomena. As lead of the R&D team, I am responsible for setting and pursuing research goals for an interdisciplinary team covering polymer scientists, mechanical engineers and software engineers. Collaboration and shared understanding are key to success in interdisciplinary teams.

I have lead the R&D department of [Hubs](https://hubs.com) (formerly 3D Hubs), the largest network for online manufacturing services.
We use computational geometry to extract relevant information from 3D models and deep learning to use this information in interesting ways.

Printivate was a 3D model repair and optimization platform that targets 3D printing. This was achieved through a 3D model processing SaaS platform
that was easy to integrate into existing products through a flexible API.

For three years I was doing full-time research in the field of resource management for large scale distributed IaaS platforms.

In 2012 I obtained a PhD in Resource management for large scale Cloud Platforms at
Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon in the Avalon research team, under
the supervision of [Frédéric Desprez](https://fdesprez.github.io/) and [Eddy Caron](http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~ecaron/). Over the period of
my PhD I worked on automatic application scaling and criterion-based
deployment of large-scale applications on Infrastructure as a Service Cloud
platforms.
